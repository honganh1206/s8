A toy programming language written in Go.

This is based on the books "Writing An Interpreter In Go" and "Writing A Compiler In Go" by Thorsten Ball, but I intend to extend it further.

## TODOs

- [x] Use `rune` instead of `byte` for chars
- Token types from [bantam-go](https://github.com/obzva/bantam-go)
- [x] `?` as ternary/conditional operator
- [x] `~` as bitwise NOT operator
- [x] `^` as bitwise XOR operator
- [x] `|` as bitwise OR operator
- [x] `&` as bitwise AND operator
- [ ] `++` for incrementing and `--` for decrementing (Both postfix/infix and prefix)
- Object types
- [x] Float
- [ ] Double
- [ ] Lambdas
- Statements
- [ ] `switch` statement

### Future plans

- [ ] A custom garbage collector in C
- [ ] Rewrite the language in Rust

The project isn't mature enough yet but the spirit of the effort is this: https://justforfunnoreally.dev/

A toy programming language written in Go.

This is based on the books "Writing An Interpreter In Go" and "Writing A Compiler In Go" by Thorsten Ball, but I intend to extend it further.

## TODOs

- [ ] A custom garbage collector
- [ ] Rewrite the language in Rust?

The project isn't mature enough yet but the spirit of the effort is this: https://justforfunnoreally.dev/

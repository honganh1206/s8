# 3.6-Evaluating conditions

We only need to **evaluate something based on a condition**: If the condition is met, we must NEVER evaluate the else-branch

We must be clear about **what to evaluate**: If the condition is met--either because it generates a `true` or something "truthy"--we should evaluate only the consequence. But what is "truthy" by the way? It is when **it's not null AND not false**

```js
let x = 10;
// x is bound to 10, evaluates to 10 and 10 is both not null and not false
if (x) {
  puts("everything okay!");
} else {
  puts("x is too high!");
  shutdownSystem();
}
```

If a condition does not evaluate to a value, it should return `NULL` like `if (false) { 10 }`

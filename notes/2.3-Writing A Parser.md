# Writing a parser

## Parsing strategies
- Two main strategies when parsing: Top-down parsing (aka recursive descent parsing, early parsing, predictive parsing) and bottom-up parsing.
- The main difference: Top-down approach starts with *constructing the root node of the AST then descend* while bottom-up one does it the other way around.
- What we will do:
  - Parse statements
  - Parse expressions
  - Extend the parser

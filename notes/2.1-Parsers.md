# Parsers

## What is a parser byt the way?

 - A parser takes input data (mostly text) and builds a data structure (parse tree, AST, etc.) while giving a **structural** representation of the input
and checking the correct syntax in the process.
- The lexer precedes the the parser, creating tokens from the sequence of characters as input for the parser.
- All parsers share the same structure on a conceptual level: A JSON parser allows us to see the data structure when we look at the input, while it is not always obvious in other parsers. The reason might be we are not familiar with multiple programming language parsers and the data structures they produce.
- We rarely interact with the parsed source code, but one exception is the Lisp programming language - the Lisp data structures representing the source code or simply put: it treats code as data and data as code interchangeably!
- **IMPORTANT**: To understand how programming languages are parsed like how we understand how serialization languages (JSON, YAML, TOML, etc.) are parsed, we need to *understand the data structures they produce*

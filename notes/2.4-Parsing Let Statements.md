# Parsing Let Statements

Our programming language will have this following form of variable binding with `let` statement: `let <identifier> = <expression>;`

Example: A node for a variable binding in the form of `let x = 5;`

- Fields to have? One for the token itself `let`, one for the identifier `x`, one pointing to the **expression** on the right side of the variable (not the literal value `5`) => 3 in total
- Tracking? The node also needs to keep track of the token it is associated with so we can implement the `TokenLiteral()` method. => A field named `Token` of type `Token`

As to why the identifier in the `let` statement does not produce a value but it still implements the `Expression` interface? _To keep things simple_: Some identifiers **DO** produce value like `let x = valueProducingIdentifier`.

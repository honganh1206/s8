# Parsing Let statements

- What is parsing let statements correctly? => Our parser must produce an AST that *accurately represent the information contained in the original let statement*
 - Our programming language will have this following form of variable binding with `let` statement: `let <identifier> = <expression>;`
- Note: An expression produces a value, a statement does not. However, what exactly an expression or a statement is or which one produces the value *depends on the language*. A function literal could be an expression in some languages while in others it is not (it will be in s8 though!)

```js
// An example of a function literal
 const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};
```
- Example: A node for a variable binding in the form of `let x = 5;`
  - Fields to have? One for the token itself `let`, one for the identifier `x`, one pointing to the **expression** on the right side of the variable (not the literal value `5`)
  - Tracking? The node also needs to keep track of the token it is associated with so we can implement the `TokenLiteral()` method.

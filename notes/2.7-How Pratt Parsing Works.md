# How Pratt Parsing Works

## Similarities & Differences between our implementation and Pratt's

- Pratt use **nuds** (null denotations) to call `prefixParseFns` and **leds** (left denotations) to call `infixParseFns`

- Our implementation of `parseExpression()` is _strikingly similar_ to the code presented in Pratt's paper, as we use the same algorithm with barely any changes.

## How things work

- Supposed we are parsing this expression statement: `1 + 2 + 3;`. What we want is an AST that looks like this (as a string): `((1 + 2) + 3)`.

- Apparently, we need **two `*ast.InfixExpression` nodes** to construct this AST: The higher one should have the integer literal 3 as the right child node and the second `*ast.InfixExpression` as the left child node. The two integer literals 1 and 2 will be the right and left child node of the second `*ast.InfixExpression` node respectively.

- The process:

1. `parseExpressionStatement()` calls `parseExpression(LOWEST)`. The `p.currentToken` and `p.peekToken` are the `1` and the first `+`:

```js
1   +   2   +   3    ;
^   ^
|   |
|   p.peekToken
p.currentToken
```

2. (Inside `parseExpression()`) We check if there is a parsing function associated with `p.currentToken` of type `token.INT` -> Yes, we call for `parseIntegerLiteral()` which returns a `*ast.IntegerLiteral{Value: 1}` as the left expression.

3. (Inside `parseExpression()`) We enter the loop with the `p.currentPrecedence` as LOWEST and the next token not a semicolon (conditions satisfied). We then fetch the `infixParseFn` for the peek token `+` and advance the current token:

```js
1   +   2   +   3    ;
   ^   ^
   |   |
   |   p.peekToken
   p.currentToken
```

4. The `parseInfixExpression()` is invoked with the passed-in left expression `*ast.IntegerLiteral{Value: 1}`

5. (Inside `parseInfixExpression()`) We construct an AST node of type `ast.InfixExpression{Operator: +. Left: 1}`, set `p.currentPrecedence` as `PLUS` instead of `LOWEST`, advance the current token (which is now `2`) and call the `parseExpression(+)` method. The tokens at this point looks like this:

```js
1   +   2   +   3    ;
       ^   ^
       |   |
       |   p.peekToken
       p.currentToken
```

6. The `parseExpression(+)` (called the 2nd time) again looks for a `prefixParseFn` for `2` -> Again `parseIntegerLiteral()`. The `p.peekToken` is now `+` (the 2nd one) but it is _not_ smaller than the previous `+` operator (same precedence), thus we do not enter the `for` loop again but instead parse the value `2` then return
   `*ast.IntegerLiteral{Value: 2}`

The AST at this point looks like this:

```js
// Note that we build the AST from the ground up
InfixExpression {
       Token: PLUS
       Operator: "+"
       Left: IntegerLiteral {
           Token: INT
           Value: 1
       }
       Right: IntegerLiteral {
           Token: INT
           Value: 2
       }
   }
}
```

7. We return the above `*ast.InfixExpression` from `parseInfixExpression()` and now we are back in the outer-most call of `parseExpression()` (reaching the base case, now we are popping function calls from the call stack) where the precedence is still LOWEST. Thus, we **enter the loop for the 2nd time** with the left expression as `*ast.InfixExpression{1+2}`

8. (Inside the loop of `parseExpression()`) We fetch the `parseInfixExpression()` as the `infixParseFn` for `p.peekToken` (which is the second `+`), advance the tokens and call `parseInfixExpression(*ast.InfixExpression{1+2})`.

Our current tokens look like this:

```js
1   +   2   +   3    ;
           ^   ^
           |   |
           |   p.peekToken
           p.currentToken
```

9. (Inside `parseInfixExpression()`) We advance our tokens (current token is now the value `3`), call the `parseExpression()` again, which calls for `parseIntegerLiteral()` and then returns the last `*ast.IntegerLiteral{Value: 3}`

The AST at this point looks like this:

```js
InfixExpression {
    Token: PLUS
    Right: IntegerLiteral {
        Token: INT
        Value: 3
        }
    Operator: "+"
    Left: InfixExpression {
        Token: PLUS
        Operator: "+"
        Left: IntegerLiteral {
            Token: INT
            Value: 1
        }
        Right: IntegerLiteral {
            Token: INT
            Value: 2
        }
    }
}
```

And here are our current tokens:

```js
1   +   2   +   3   ;
               ^   ^
               |   |
               |   p.peekToken
               p.currentToken
```

10. Now that we reach the semicolon, we don't have to enter the loop for the 3rd time. We now have the full `*ast.InfixExpression{1 + 2 + 3}` back to our `parseExpressionStatement()` and it will be used to populate the field `Expression` of `*ast.ExpressionStatement`

The end result is an AST that looks like:

```js
    +
   / \
  +   3
 / \
1   2
```

## The "real precedence issues"

- What if we just use LOWEST by default and something called HIGHEST for all operators? **NO** because that woud give us a wrong AST: The goal is **to nest expressions involving operators of a higher precedence to be DEEPER in the tree**
- When `parseExpression()` is called, the value of `precedence` stands for the current [[Right-binding Power]] of the current `parseExpression()` invocation.

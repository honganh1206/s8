# Parsing Expressions

- Parsing expressions contains a few more challenges. One of them is the operator precedence: Supposed we want to parse the expression `5 * 5 + 10`, then the AST should represent the expression like `((5 * 5) + 10)`.

- The parser should know about the **operator precedences** of other cases like the "precedence bump" of `5 * (5 + 10)`

- The validity of a token's position depends on the **context**: The tokens that come before and after, and their precedence.

  - In expressions, _tokens of the same type can appear in multiple positions_. An example would be `-5 - 10` where the token `-` works as both the prefix operator and infix operator!
  - The parentheses also work as operators: In expressions like `5 * (add(2, 3) + 10)`, the outer pair of parentheses denotes a _grouped expression_, while the inner pair is a _call expression_.

- The **drill** for parsing different type of statements: We _build our AST node of that statement type_ then we try to _fill its field by calling the parsing functions_.

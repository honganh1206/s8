# Representing the objects

Our programming language will be **object-oriented**. We need a system that _represent the values our AST represents_ or _represents values we generate when evaluating the AST in memory_

Given this code:

```js
let a = 5;
a + a;
```

It is important that when we come across the `a + a` expression later on, we need to _access the value that `a` is bound to_ i.e., the value `5`

But there lies a question: How are we going to keep track of and represent the `5` _while_ we are evaluating the rest of the AST?

## How this works

When we encounter an integer literal in the source code, we turn it into an `ast.IntegerLiteral` -> When evaluating that AST node, we turn it into an `object.Integer`

Adding null to a programming language is tricky, not because of the implementation but safety. But we are here to learn, and having a fast car makes you drive more carefully

# Representing the objects

Our programming language will be **object-oriented**

We need a system that _represent the values our AST represents_ or _represents values we generate when evaluating the AST in memory_

Given this code:

```js
let a = 5;
a + a;
```

It is important that when we come across the `a + a` expression later on, we need to _access the value that `a` is bound to_ i.e., the value `5`

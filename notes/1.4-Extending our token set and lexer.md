# Extending our token set and lexer

- Three classifications of the tokens: One-character token, two-character token and keyword token
- Note that the lexer does not need to tell us whether the code makes sense, works or contain error - Its sole responsibility is to convert characters into tokens to be handled in later stages.
- For two-character tokens, we cannot add more switch cases by just comparing `l.ch` with strings like `==`. Instead, we can *reuse* existing switch branches for `=` and `!` and extend them.
- Most lexers and parsers have a "peek" function that *looks ahead and returns the immediate next character". One difficulty of parsing different languages often boils down to *how far you have to peek ahead/look backwards in the source code to make sense of it".
- Tip: If we were to add more two-character tokens, it would be better to separate the logic to a separate method called `makeTwoCharToken` that peeks and advances if we found the right token.

# Evaluating prefix expressions

Prefix expressions in this section are just _operator expressions with one operator and one operand_

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are defining the semantics of our language. A small change in the evaluation of operator expressions might cause something unintended in a part of a language that seems unrelated.

We first evaluate its operand and then use the result of this evaluation with the operator

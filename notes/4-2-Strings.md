# 4-2-Strings

Strings are **a sequence of characters**, just like in C

Strings are **first-class values**: They could be bound to identifiers, used as arguments, and returned by functions

The structure: `"<sequence of characters>"`. An example would be `"Hello World"` as a **whole** token instead of each thing as a token

## String concatenation

We need to add support for the `+` infix operator with string operands in this case

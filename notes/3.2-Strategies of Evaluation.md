# Strategies of Evaluation

The ways we evaluate our code differ with different interpreter implementations

> [!IMPORTANT]

While it is believed that an interpreter does not leave executable artifacts behind (in contrast to the compiler, which does just that), _real-world and highly optimized programming languages prove this to be gray_ -- the two notions get fuzzy real fast

## Classical approach

Traverse the AST by visiting each node -> Do what the nodes denote -- All on the fly

This is called [**tree-walking interpreters**](./3.3-Tree-walking Interpreter.md)--the archetype of interpreters

> [!NOTE]
> Sometimes the evaluation step is preceded by small optimizations that _rewrite the AST_ e.g., remove unused variable bindings, convert AST into another intermediate representation (IR)

## Alternatives

1. Convert the AST into [bytecode](./Bytecode.md) then interpret it
2. **The parser emits bytecode directly** (That is where the thin line between a interpreter and a compiler is)
3. Parse the source code -> build an AST -> convert the AST to bytecode -> VM then compiles the bytecode to native machine code _right before it is executed_. That is the **JIT (Just In Time) interpreter/compiler**
4. Skip the compilation to bytecode and _recursively traverse the AST_ but before we execute a particular branch of the AST, **the node is compiled to native machine code**
5. The interpreter recursively evaluates the AST and _only after evaluating a particular branch multiple times does the interpreter compiles that branch into native machine code_

## What to choose?

It depends on: Performance, portability needs, the programming language being interpreted, and how far you are willing to go

A tree-walking interpreter is slow but easier to build. An interpreter that compiles our source code to bytecode and use an VM for bytecode evaluation is faster but much more complicated. And adding JIT means we need to _consider multiple machine architectures_

## Examples

Ruby switched from using a tree-walking interpreter to a VM architecture

JavaScript used AST walking as its first approach. Now the engine has **four different stages of JIT compilation**

Lua went from compiling to bytecode and executing the bytecode in a VM to _compiling a dense bytecode format to highly optimized machine code for different architectures with LuaJIT_

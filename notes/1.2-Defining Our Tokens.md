# Defining Our Tokens

- What to do? Define some tolems + add more when extending the lexer

```
let five = 5;
let ten = 10;

let add = funk(x, y) {
  x + y;
};

let result = add(five, ten);
```

- Several types of tokens here: Numbers, variable names, words that are not variable names (let), special characters...We treat numbers as they are and give them a separate type. Variable names will be treated as *identifiers* and the non-variable names will be the *keywords*, and the special characters will be given their own type.

- Note: Using `string` to hold literal values helps a lot with debugging: We can just print it!

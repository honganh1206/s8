# Giving meaning to symbols

The evaluation process of an interpreter defines _how the programming language being interpreted_

Consider this code block:

```js
let num = 5;
if (num) {
  return a;
} else {
  return b;
}
```

In some languages this is truthy, in others we need to _use an expression that produces a boolean_ like 5 != 0

Another example:

```js
let one = funk () {
  printLine("one")
  return 1
}

let two = funk () {
  printLine("two")
  return 2
}

add(one(), two())
```

What would be printed first? It depends on the **specification of the language when implementing the interpreter** and **which order the interpreter evaluates the expressions in the arguments**

This is where this programming language comes to life

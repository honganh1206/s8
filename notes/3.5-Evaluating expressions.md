# 3.5-Evaluating Expressions

We will be working on this:

```go
func Eval(node ast.Node) object.Object
```

Every node we defined in `ast` fulfills the `ast.Node` interface, so all of them can be passed to `Eval`

We will _use `Eval` recursively_ by calling itself while evaluating a part of the ast, just like we said in [this section](./3.2-Strategies of Evaluation.md)
What would `Eval` do? When we pass `*ast.Program` node to `Eval`, the function should **evaluate each of `*ast.Program.Statements`** by **calling itself** with a single statement. Here is the recursive part: The return value of the outer call to `Eval` is the **return value** of the last call

We first start with [Self-evaluating expressions](Self-evaluating%20expressions.md)

Note that we should always **start at the top of the AST, receive an `*ast.Program`, then traverse every node in it**

# 3.5-Evaluating Expressions

We will be working on this:

```go
func Eval(node ast.Node) object.Object
```

Every node we defined in `ast` fulfills the `ast.Node` interface, so all of them can be passed to `Eval`

We will _use `Eval` recursively_ by calling itself while evaluating a part of the ast, just like we said in [this section](./3.2-Strategies of Evaluation.md)
What would `Eval` do? When we pass `*ast.Program` node to `Eval`, the function should **evaluate each of `*ast.Program.Statements`** by **calling itself** with a single statement. Here is the recursive part: The return value of the outer call to `Eval` is the **return value** of the last call

Note that we should always **start at the top of the AST, receive an `*ast.Program`, then traverse every node in it**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are doing **pointer comparison** here as our method arguments are _pointers instead of values_, and pointer comparison is much faster since _we are comparing the same instances_.

> [!WARNING]
> We can use pointer comparison for booleans as operands, but we cannot do so with integer operands since _we are always creating new pointers_. For this reason, `5 == 5` would be false since we are comparing pointers with `object.Object` as value wrapper.

# Processor Registers

Part of the CPU, and way faster to access than the main memory (Lower memory level - Might be L1?)

But it is not idea to store a large amount of data (we can store only one word per register)

Example: A CPU of the x84-64 architecture has 16 general purpose registers, each holding 64 bits of data

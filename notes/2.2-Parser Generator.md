# Why not a parser generator?

## Parser generators

- Tools that can output parsers when fed with a formal description of a language. Some examples are yacc, bison and ANTLR.
- Most parser generators use *context-free grammer* (CFG) - a set of rules to form a correct sentence in a language - as their input.
- Some common notational formats of CFGs are the [[Backus-Naur Form]] (BNF) or the [[Extended Backus-Naur Form]] (EBNF)
- Although parsers are a solved problem, we will learn a lot if we write our own parser. Everything hard to understand might "click" at some  point after you make it from scratch.
